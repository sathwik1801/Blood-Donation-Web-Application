<h1 color:"blue">Why is this app needed ?</h1>
<p>Blood is an essential component of our lives.
    Due to unexpected events such as accidents or diseases we undergo blood loss. 
    Then comes the requirement of blood donors.
    But how to search them in a limited time span.
    Many people die due to lack of donated blood
    </p>
<h1>A Proposed System</h1>
<p>When ever a recipient needs blood he enters the details such as hospital admitted in , blood group required etc.
    which mails the these details to the donors in the database. Due to which we are providing security to the donors details.
    As well as mentioning the hospital is mandatory chances for illegal sale is reduced.
