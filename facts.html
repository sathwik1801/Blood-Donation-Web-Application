<p> * Nearly 7% of the body weight of a human is made up of blood.</p>
<p> * Platelets, white blood cells and red blood cells are present in blood.</p>
<p> * Blood consists of a yellow liquid which is known as blood plasma.</p>
<p> * Blood plasma is primarily made up of water. 90% of blood plasma is water.</p>
<p> * Blood plasma also consists of hormones, glucose, proteins, gases, electrolytes and nutrients.</p>
<p> * Platelets, white blood cells and red blood cells are all found floating in blood plasma.</p>
<p> * Blood plasma can be separated using centrifuge device which spins blood at a very high speed. The cells then get collected at the bottom of the tube, separating blood plasma from the cells.</p>
<p> * Only the red blood cells in our blood are responsible for carrying oxygen.</p>\
<p> * Red blood cells consist of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is actually a protein that contains iron. Oxygen combines with this iron and gives the characteristic red color to our blood as well as hemoglobin.</p>
<p> * Unlike red blood cells, the white blood cells in our blood form the defensive system of our body. These white blood cells are responsible for fighting viruses, bacteria and other infectious diseases. They also fight cancer cells and other unwanted material that enter human body.</p>
